## What is it?
Alpha Dispatch is a system that allows you to send messages to your users, which can be used for various purposes such as sending notifications, updates, or any other type of message.

## How does it work?
The system works by allowing you to create and manage different types of messages. You can specify the content of each message, including text, images, videos, or any other media files. Once you have created a message, you can choose who should receive it and when they should receive it.
